	 * Measure calculation happens in two stages. The first/upper stage does

	 * TrackDataCache.calculate() actually does this job. The sort of
	 * calculations is such that the other measures could benefit from
	 * it and re-use it (instead of loading images again and doing some
	 * calculations again), and the results are stored in the cache.
	 * The second/bottom stage is measure-specific. It basically finishes
	 * the measure calculation procedure, possible using data from the cache.
	 *
	 * This function is asked to use, if applicable, such cache data
	 * as the caller believes the given cache is still valid. The measure
	 * can only carry on with the bottom stage then (thus being overall faster
	 * than when computing both stages).
	 *
	 * The class never re-uses its own cache to allow for fresh complete
	 * re-calculation on the (new) data in the same folders.
	 *
	 * This is the main CHA calculator.
