1) Download the most recent version of Fiji from http://fiji.sc/
2) Install it, and pay attention where (which Folder) it got installed into
3) Locate the folder where Fiji got installed, say it is folder FIJIROOT
4) Remove FIJIROOT/jars/imagej-ops-*.jar
5) Download imagej-ops-*.jar from this web page, and place it into FIJIROOT/jars
6) Download CTC_FijiPlugins*.jar from this web page, and place it into FIJIROOT/plugins


The steps 4 and 5 "upgrade" imagej-ops package inside your Fiji installation.
The new upgraded package contains routines for the merging.
The step 6 installs a GUI frontend plugin for these routines.

The merging routines can be called from command line too, suitable for batch processing.
