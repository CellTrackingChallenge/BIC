Welcome

This is a repository to hold all [Cell Tracking Challenge](http://www.celltrackingchallenge.net) related [FiJi](http://fiji.sc) tools. The tools are in the form of a Fiji GUI plugins, notes on how to install all of them just follows. However, owing to the Fiji capabilities, it is possible to call the tools also from command line.

The tools were developed and the page is maintained by [Vladimír Ulman](http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xulman/).

The ideas, that are implemented in the tools, are product of a collective collaboration between [CIMA](http://www.cima.es), [CBIA](http://cbia.fi.muni.cz), [CSBD](http://www.csbdresden.de/) and [MPI-CBG](http://mpi-cbg.de) groups.
