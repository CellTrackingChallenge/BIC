Welcome
-------
This is a repository with Java source codes of the [Fiji](http://fiji.sc) tools related to the [Cell Tracking Challenge](http://www.celltrackingchallenge.net), and to the quantitative evaluation of biomedical tracking in general. In particular, one can find here [_A Fiji Tool for Automatic Fusion of Segmentation and Tracking Labels_](https://labels.tue-image.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/LABELS2017_14.pdf).

The binaries (.jar files here) of the tools can be built with `mvn package`. The recommended method, however, is to install it via Fiji update mechanism. The Fiji update system mirrors the most recent version, and regularly checks for updates.

The tools were developed and the page is maintained by [Vladim√≠r Ulman](http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xulman/).
